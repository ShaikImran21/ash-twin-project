# Audio Assets

This folder contains sound effects for the game.

## Required Files

- `boom.wav` - Error or failure sound (played when something goes wrong)
- `collect.wav` - Success sound (played when reaching destination)
- `warp.wav` - Movement sound (played when jumping between panoramas in Trail Mode)

## How to Add Audio Files

You can:
1. **Create your own** using audio editing software
2. **Download free sounds** from sites like:
   - [Freesound.org](https://freesound.org/)
   - [Zapsplat.com](https://www.zapsplat.com/)
   - [Mixkit.co](https://mixkit.co/free-sound-effects/)
3. **Use simple beeps** generated online

## Temporary Solution

For testing, you can use any short WAV files and rename them. The game will work without audio (it handles errors gracefully).
