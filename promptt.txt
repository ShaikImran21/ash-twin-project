This is a fun idea! Adding a "Chaos Mode" (often called a "Party Mode" or "Prank Mode") is a great way to show off your front-end skills with CSS transforms, keyframes, and JavaScript manipulation.

Based on the three screenshots of your Voyager website, here is a curated list of "Chaos Prompts." You can use these specific ideas to program your toggle button.

1. The "Global Meltdown" (General Effects)
Applies to all pages.

The Techno-Color Shift: When the toggle is hit, apply a continuous CSS animation to the body tag that cycles through filter: hue-rotate(0deg) to filter: hue-rotate(360deg). This will make your "Voyager" gold branding cycle through neon pinks, greens, and blues constantly.

The Upside Down: Rotate the entire <body> or specific main containers by 180 degrees using transform: rotate(180deg).

Comic Sans Invasion: Force every single text element to change its font family: * { font-family: 'Comic Sans MS', 'Chalkboard SE', sans-serif !important; }.

2. Homepage Chaos (Screenshot 1)
Focusing on the Hero Section and Nav.

The Spinning Compass: Target the Voyager logo (top left). On toggle, give it a CSS animation to spin endlessly (animation: spin 2s linear infinite).

Drunken Navigation: Target the Nav Links (Home, Destinations, etc.). Make them float randomly. Use CSS keyframes to make them translate slightly X and Y and rotate slightly, so it looks like the menu is drifting apart.

Anti-Gravity Hero Text: Target the main heading "Extraordinary Journeys Await". Break the words into separate span tags and apply a "falling" animation where they slowly drop off the bottom of the screen, or float up like bubbles.

3. Transportation Page Chaos (Screenshot 2)
Focusing on the Booking Widget.

The Runaway Button: Add a JavaScript event listener to the Search Button (or the main CTA). When the user's mouse hovers over it, randomly change its top and left position (absolute positioning) so the user can never click it.

The "Turbulence" Input: Target the Input Fields (Departure City, Destination City). Add a CSS animation called "shake" (using translateX) that triggers whenever the user clicks into a box to type. It simulates flight turbulence.

Flying Planes: You have a small plane icon next to "Search Flights." Detach it from its position and make it fly across the screen in loop-de-loops using SVG path animation or CSS offsets.

4. Destinations Page Chaos (Screenshot 3)
Focusing on the Cards and Filters.

The Deck Shuffle: Target the destination cards (Santorini, Bali, Iceland). On toggle, collapse them all into a single pile in the center of the screen (using position: absolute), and then fan them out like a hand of playing cards.

Bouncing Pills: Target the filter pills (Beach, Adventure, Nature, etc.). Give them physics! Make them bounce around the container border like the old DVD logo screensaver.

Wrong Destinations: Use JavaScript to swap the images but keep the text. Put the Iceland glacier image inside the Bali card, and the Santorini image on the Iceland card. It creates subtle cognitive chaos.
